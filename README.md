Project Title

Scrutinising Behavioural and Regional Patterns in Aadhaar Enrolment and Demographic Updates

Overview

This repository contains exploratory data analysis notebooks developed for the UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026.
The project analyses Aadhaar enrolment and demographic update datasets to identify regional, behavioural, and temporal patterns across Indian states and districts.

Contents

01_enrolment_exploration.ipynb
Exploratory analysis of Aadhaar enrolment data with a focus on:

State-wise and regional patterns

Age group participation trends

Temporal stability and variation


01_demographic_exploration.ipynb
Exploratory analysis of Aadhaar demographic update data, including:

District-level behavioural patterns

Age-based update distributions

Regional contrasts and anomalies



Approach

Raw datasets are merged and cleaned before analysis.

States and districts are treated as independent analytical units.

Comparisons avoid population-based assumptions and instead focus on behavioural trends.

Insights are intended to support policy-level reasoning and solution frameworks.


Notes

The notebooks represent exploratory and analytical groundwork for the hackathon submission.

Visualisations and insights may evolve as the project progresses.

A future extension includes integrating insights into a Streamlit-based interface with AI-assisted interpretation.
